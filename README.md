#A Tour of Go
In this repository I store my solutions for all Tour of Go exersises as well as the manually typed Go code from all other portions of the tutorial. The exception is the very last exersise, the webcrawler, as I had a minor error with my mutex and duplicated another solutions code to learn from it.
